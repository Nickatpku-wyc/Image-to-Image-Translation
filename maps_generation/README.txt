For Assign2, I've changed the code file below: 

_init_py(pytorch_ssim/pytorch_ssim/) for Q;

map_dataest.py(data/) for Q2;

base/train/test_options.py(options/) for training configuration;

train.sh & test.sh for training configuration;

test.py(pytorch_ssim) for evaluate ssim;

No other file modified or added.
